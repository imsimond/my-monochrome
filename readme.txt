Bored of the default WordPress admin color schemes? So was I. Generate color schemes to your heart's content, with a single click.

== Description ==

My Monochrome Admin Palette is a simple plugin that generates a custom WordPress admin color scheme based on a single color, chosen by the user directly, or at random.

It was inspired by testing sessions, involving multiple different WordPress user accounts logging into the same instance. A different dashboard meant it was easy to keep track of which user was which.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin in the usual way.
2. Go to your user profile page ('Users' -> 'Profile').
3. Select the "Mono" admin color scheme.
4. Use the randomize button or the color picker to select a color. The new scheme will be applied immediately.
5. If you used the color picker, click the icon again to close it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will my chosen color be shared with other users? =

No, it is stored on a per-user basis.

= Does this work with all themes? =

It only affects the WordPress admin area, so it works with all themes.

= It doesn't recolor such-and-such an element. =

It's fair to say that the current `wp-admin` interface was not constructed with easy recoloring in mind. Although the plugin attempts to cover every scenario and element, it's almost certain that some will be missed. We will add extra CSS rules as we become aware of any such misses.

= I wish I could specify a secondary color. =

Sorry, we won't be adding this feature. The clue is in the name.

== Screenshots ==

1. The "Mono" color scheme option on the user profile page.
